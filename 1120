1. Which statements belong in a procedure’s epilogue when the procedure has stack parameters and local variables? 
The epilogue contains:
	•	mov esp, ebp
	•	pop ebp
	•	ret (or ret n for stdcall)

2. When a C function returns a 32-bit integer, where is the return value stored?

It is stored in the EAX register.

3. How does a program using the STDCALL calling convention clean up the stack after a procedure call?

The callee cleans up the stack using ret n.

4. How is the LEA instruction more powerful than the OFFSET operator?

OFFSET gives a static address at compile time, while LEA can compute effective addresses dynamically at runtime.

5. How much stack space is used by a variable of type int (in the example)?

An int uses 4 bytes.

6. What advantages does the C calling convention have over STDCALL?

cdecl (C calling convention) allows variable arguments (like printf) because the caller cleans the stack.

7. (True/False) When using the PROC directive, all parameters must be listed on the same line.

False. They do not have to be on the same line.

8. (True/False) Passing a byte-array offset to a word-pointer parameter will cause an assembler error.

False. The assembler usually does not treat this as an error.

9. (True/False) Passing an immediate value to a reference parameter can cause a general-protection fault.

True. A reference parameter expects a valid memory address, not an immediate value.
